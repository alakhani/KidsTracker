# KidsTracker
This is a simple Android based application that uses geolocation and fencing to keep a check on people/ children.
This application offers 3 functionalities:
1) One can directly get the current location of the device with just a click of a button
2) One can add a fence around a specific area for specific time intervals. If between those time intervals, the device leaves the area, a notication is generated.
3) One can mark an area as prohibited. If the device enters the vicinity of that area, a notification is generated.
